# Replication Package for Paper: KMOR
This repository contains the datasets used in our paper **"KMOR: Finding Top-k Multi-constraint Optimal Routes over On-demand Transportation Networks"** to ensure the reproducibility of our work, as some original data links have become inaccessible.

## üîß Usage

The datasets are provided in their original format. Each road network dataset typically consists of a file:
- A **`*edge`** file containing edge information with start and end nodes.

## üöÄ Algorithms

### K-PURN Search (`kpurn_search`)
- **Purpose**: Finds promising route networks for multi-constraint routing
- **Key Features**:
  - Efficient pruning of suboptimal routes
  - Multi-constraint optimization
  - Scalable network exploration

### DP-KMOR (`dpkmor`) 
- **Purpose**: Dynamic programming approach for Top-k Multi-constraint Optimal Routes
- **Key Features**:
  - Exact algorithm for optimal route discovery
  - Handles multiple constraints simultaneously
  - Returns top-k diverse optimal routes
