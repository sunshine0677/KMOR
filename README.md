# Replication Package for Paper: KMOR
This repository contains the datasets used in our paper **"KMOR: Finding Top-k Multi-constraint Optimal Routes over On-demand Transportation Networks"** to ensure the reproducibility of our work, as some original data links have become inaccessible.

## üîß Usage

The datasets are provided in their original format. Each road network dataset typically consists of two files:
- A **`*node`** file containing node IDs and coordinates.
- A **`*edge`** file containing edge information with start and end nodes.
